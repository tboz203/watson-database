Notes
=====

For Mike:
---------
- can create new things?
- ease of modification
  - either a tool for mike, or not
  - separation of data and logic

### TODO
- i think the relationship name needs to be in the statement.
  - would be simple enough to add a "name" field in each action
  - just pass it to the accept bit, tada
- need a fixed-width font for the statements (maybe?)
- need to add quotes around text entries
  - do we also need them around tables? we'll check into that.
- want to look into performance issues, but that will come last.
- the whole 'get smaller with the screen' thing
- modularization
  - separating data and logic
  - being able to do multiple labs w/o copying everything

---

- i'm betting we can take the 'remove' function out of the hist object array
  and put a single one in the $scope. we'd just need some way to get that index
  into it.

blah blah blah
