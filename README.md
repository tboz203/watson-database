## Watson Reboot - Database lab
2013-10-04

This project aims to be a more modern revision of the Watson Database lab. As
opposed to the java platform used in the original Watson implementation, this
version of Watson is a web application built using javascript and associated
libraries. 

Some of the open source javascript libraries used in this project are:
- JQuery
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Angular.js
- UI Bootstrap
